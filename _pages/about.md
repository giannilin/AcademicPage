## About me

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics, [Khalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

I received my PhD in Mathematics and Statistics for Computational Sciences from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it) and the Master Degree in Computing Systems Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).

Research areas:
 - theoretical computer science: limit laws for pattern statistics in rational models, computational complexity of constrained statistical clustering
 - machine learning: computer vision for robust face recognition, applied sparse representation and sparse dictionary learning, graph data prediction in bioinformatics
 - computational mathematics: sparse optimization methods, applied dynamical models
