 * [Graph Models for Learning and Recognition (GMLR 2025)](https://phuselab.di.unimi.it/GMLR2025) Track in the [40th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing (SAC 2025)](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2025) in Catania (Italy), March 31 - April 4, 2025

## About me

I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Statistics, [Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore](https://www.unicatt.it) (Italy).

I received my PhD in Mathematics and Statistics for Computational Sciences from the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it) and the Master Degree in Computing Systems Engineering from [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).

Research areas:
 - theoretical computer science: limit laws for pattern statistics in rational models, computational complexity of constrained statistical clustering
 - machine learning: computer vision for robust face recognition, applied sparse representation and sparse dictionary learning, graph models for learning and recognition, network-based prediction in bioinformatics
 - computational mathematics: sparse optimization methods, applied dynamical models
